<H1>Book Store Website</H1>
<p>A website created using Python, Django, DB Browser, HTML, and CSS. It is a basic website for a bookstore that displays the entire available catalog of the bookstore. It also showcases information about the authors, book synopses, and ISBN. All this information is updated and stored in the database with the help of DB Browser, leveraging the advantages provided by Django to accomplish this.</p>
